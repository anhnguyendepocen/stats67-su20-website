## Part 1 - Loading Data

In this lecture we have started learning about data matrices. The following code (you do not have to understand it) calls the data about work of Bob Ross.

```{r message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(fivethirtyeight)
bob_ross <- bob_ross %>% 
  mutate(tree = as.factor(tree),
         mountain = as.factor(mountain))


```

## Part 2 - Getting to Know the Data
Here glimpse at your data






## Part 3 - Summarizing Data

We will learn how to summarize data with numbers

```{r}
count(bob_ross, tree)
```


By the end of this week's lecture we will learn how to visualize data!

```{r}
ggplot(bob_ross) +
  aes(x = tree) +
  geom_bar()
```
