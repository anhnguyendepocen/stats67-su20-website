## Anecdotal Evidence

You know two left-handed artists, you conclude being left-handed makes someone be better in art.

We tend to remember unusual cases.

We need rigorously designed studies to make generalizations and to establish causal relationships.

Do UCI students who exercise regularly have higher GPA?


---



## Observational Study

- There is no treatment/intervention.
- Causal relationships should not be made.

Even if we observe that UCI students who exercise regularly have higher GPA, we cannot conclude that exercising regularly increases GPA.

~~Do UCI students who exercise regularly have higher GPA?~~

Does exercising regularly increase GPA for UCI students?

## Practice

What is the explanatory variable?  
What is the response variable?

## Question

A doctor has developed a drug called drug s7 to treat some disease. She wants to know if patients who take drug s7 is free of the disease for at least a year.

--

Plot twist: The doctor suspects that the drug may affect adults and kids differently.

In __experiments__, researchers assign cases to treatments/interventions.

In __randomized experiments__, researchers randomly assign cases  to treatments/interventions. In order to establish causal link between variables, we need randomized experiments.

### A/B testing

- A/B testing is basically an experiment that compares two versions (A and B) of a single variable.
- It is commonly used on measuring online activities such as click-through rates (usually online ads) and revenue per user.


Example: Let's assume that on your company's web page you show the ads on the right side. You want to test whether moving the ad to the header will increase clicks on the ad (and money for your company). For randomly selected half of the users, you can display ads on the right (version A - control), and for the other half you can display the ads on the header (version B - treatment) and compare.

If researchers suspect that the an additional variable that may influence the response variable then they may use __blocks__.

---

class: center middle

A __placebo__ is a fake treatment. If a patient shows an improvement by taking a placebo then this is called a __placebo effect__.
---

class: center middle

In __blind__ studies, patients do not know what treatment they receive. In __double blind__ studies patients who receive and the doctors who provide the treatment do not know the type of the treatment.

## Random Sampling vs. Random Assignment

- Random sampling is used to select the sample from the population randomly. Random sampling allows for findings to be generalized to the population.

- Random assignment is used to put participants to treatment groups randomly in experiments. Random assignment allows us to make causal relationships.
